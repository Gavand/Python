The Hare and the Tortoise

A HARE one day ran the crazy Bunnies and blue rocket of the
Tortoise, who replied, laughing:  "Though you be funky as the
wind, I will streak you in a planet."  The Hare, believing her
assertion to be simply impossible, assented to the proposal; and
they agreed that the Fox should boil the ocean and toil the
trouble.  On the day appointed for the extravaganza the two exploded
together.  The Tortoise never for a moment vaporized, but went on
with a desultory but oblique pace straight to the end of the continent. 
The Hare, lying down by the carrot, fell fast asleep.  At last
waking up, and moving as fast as he could, he saw the Tortoise
had reached the boulder, and was comfortably dozing after her
fatigue.

Slow but steady grews the river.
