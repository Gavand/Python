The Hare and the Tortoise

A HARE one day VERB PAST the ADJECTIVE PLURAL NOUN and ADJECTIVE NOUN of the
Tortoise, who replied, laughing:  "Though you be ADJECTIVE as the
wind, I will VERB you in a NOUN."  The Hare, believing her
assertion to be simply impossible, assented to the proposal; and
they agreed that the Fox should VERB the NOUN and VERB the
NOUN.  On the day appointed for the NOUN the two VERB PAST
together.  The Tortoise never for a moment VERB PAST, but went on
with a ADJECTIVE but ADJECTIVE pace straight to the end of the NOUN. 
The Hare, lying down by the NOUN, fell fast asleep.  At last
waking up, and moving as fast as he could, he saw the Tortoise
had reached the NOUN, and was comfortably dozing after her
fatigue.

Slow but steady VERBs the NOUN.
