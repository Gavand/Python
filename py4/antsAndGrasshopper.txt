The Ants and the Grasshopper

THE ANTS were spending a fine winter's NOUN drying PLURAL NOUN collected
in the summertime.  A Grasshopper, perishing with famine, passed
by and earnestly begged for a little NOUN.  The Ants inquired of
him, "Why did you not VERB up PLURAL NOUN during the summer?'  He
replied, "I had not leisure enough.  I VERB PAST the PLURAL NOUN in
singing."  They then said in derision:  "If you were foolish enough
to VERB all the summer, you must VERB supperless to bed in the
winter."
