The Wolf and the Lamb

The WOLF, meeting with a Lamb astray from the fold, resolved not to
lay ADJECTIVE PLURAL NOUN on him, but to find some NOUN to justify to the
Lamb the Wolf's right to VERB him.  He thus VERB PAST him:
"Sirrah, last year you grossly VERB PAST me."  "Indeed," VERB PAST
the Lamb in a ADJECTIVE tone of voice, "I was not then born."  Then
said the Wolf, "You VERB in my NOUN."  "No, good sir," replied
the Lamb, "I have not yet VERB PAST NOUN."  Again said the Wolf,
"You VERB of my NOUN."  "No," exclaimed the Lamb, "I never yet
VERB PAST NOUN, for as yet my mother's NOUN is both NOUN and NOUN
to me."  Upon which the Wolf VERB PAST him and VERB PAST him up, saying,
"Well! I won't remain supperless, even though you VERB every
one of my PLURAL NOUN."

The NOUN will always VERB a NOUN for his NOUN.
